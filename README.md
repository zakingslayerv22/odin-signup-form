The Odin Sign-up form presented the opportunity to flex some of the skills acquired so far in the Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The project was centered about styling a HTML form and some basic client-side form validation. 

During the course of the project, I saw the need for relative units, custom fonts, advanced selectors and other skills taught so far in this intermediate course. Every step along this project gave me confidence - I even implemented a little responsiveness and worked with the Constraint Validation API. 

The intermediate course is not yet over and I feel more confident with CSS. I know there is still a lot to learn but I am aware now that I wield some power - however little that is.

I have to go and complete the Intermediate HTML and CSS course. 

See you around.

À bientôt!
